rs2269879	DOT1L	hydrochlorothiazide	22440088	Efficacy	yes	In the PEAR cohort, in Whites: 5.5 mmHg greater mean systolic bp response(p = 0.0002 uncorrected) and a 3.5 mmHg greater mean diastolic bp response (p = 0.0016 uncorrected).

This did not replicate significantly in a second cohort(GERA) and authors concluded that there could possibly be an association between this SNP and  blood pressure response to HCTZ in Caucasians, but that it requires further investigation.  Significance for this segment of the study was set at p < 0.01 for a partially corrected p, and in Whites, this level was met when a partial correction for multiple testing was done.  But for a compound, corrected p predetermined by the authors to be the significance point for both segments of the study, the significance test  failed.

rs222749	TRPV1	botulinum toxin type a	31014225	Efficacy	yes	The A allele was found at a significantly higher frequency in non-responders than in responders. Note that this variant was not present at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the study cohort (p=0.00006).

rs2973049	GDNF	paroxetine	24577123	Efficacy	yes	To ensure the accuracy of the results, multiple linear regression models were applied, and 3 SNPs were still identified as significant determinants of paroxetine clinical response (P rs 6265 = 0.001, P rs 2973049 = 0.011, and P rs 2216711 = 0.010). According to all of the analyses, the variability in paroxetine clinical response could be attributed to plasma concentration and SNPs.

rs7608731	GALNT14	cisplatin, fluorouracil, mitoxantrone	21635146	Efficacy	yes	Please note; allele frequencies in the responder group deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p=0.03) [stat_test: chi squared allele test]	Allele C is associated with response to cisplatin, fluorouracil and mitoxantrone in people with Carcinoma, Hepatocellular as compared to allele T.

rs61734430	FOLR3	pemetrexed	24732178	Efficacy	yes	Patients with one or more T alleles had an increased likelihood of disease progression at mid-treatment radiological evaluation, as compared to those with the CC genotype.	Genotypes CT + TT is associated with decreased response to pemetrexed in people with Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung and Mesothelioma as compared to genotype CC.	CT + TT	C
rs4796793	STAT3	interferons	17602083	Efficacy	yes	IFN-alpha.; Careful- GC SNP.  Based on dbSNP population frequencies in Asians(and orientation of dbSNP exemplar sequence and FastA sequence compared to + Golden Path strand), I reversed the designations used in the article, but I'm not completely sure this is correct.  Also,  the p I've entered is not adjusted for multiple testing, and if adjusted: 0.0039 * 423(for tested SNPs) = 1.6.; [stat_test: pearson's chi square]	Genotype GG is associated with increased response to interferons in people with Carcinoma, Renal Cell as compared to genotypes CC + CG.	GG	G
rs2233945	PSORS1C1	etanercept	28107378	Efficacy	yes	The degree of response was determined by EULAR score.; A significant association between rs2233945 and response to etanercept was seen at six months after beginning treatment. No significant association was seen at two years after beginning treatment.; No significant associations were seen at either time point when response was measured as number of patients in remission or with low disease activity.	Allele C is associated with decreased response to etanercept in people with Arthritis, Rheumatoid as compared to allele A.	C	C
rs2900478	SLCO1B1	hmg coa reductase inhibitors	25350695	Efficacy	yes	Carriers of this variant respond to statins with a 1.6% smaller LDL-C lowering effect per minor allele compared with non-carriers.	Allele A is associated with decreased response to hmg coa reductase inhibitors as compared to allele T.	A	T
rs4742610	PTPRD	trandolapril, verapamil	26425837	Efficacy	yes	This was associated with resistant hypertension in whites and Hispanics in the international verapamil SR trandolapril study (meta-analysis P=3.2×10-5).	Allele T is associated with resistance to trandolapril and verapamil in people with Hypertension as compared to allele C.	T	C
rs1056515	RGS5	bevacizumab, fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin	25069475	Efficacy	yes	For specifically tumors occurring in the right colon. Patients were receiving treatment with bevacizumab + FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan). Patients with the TT genotype responded better than patients with the GG or GT genotype.	Genotype TT is associated with increased response to bevacizumab, fluorouracil, irinotecan and leucovorin in people with Colorectal Neoplasms as compared to genotypes GG + GT.	TT	G
rs4986791	TLR4	prednisolone	37638833	Efficacy	yes	"""Likewise, having p.Thr399Ile variant was significantly associated with chronic ITP (OR 5.14, 95% CI: 1.6–17.4, p = .002) and non-response to therapy with steroids (OR 6.1, 95% CI: 1.01–49.06, p = .046) but not TPO-RA (OR 1.57, 95% CI: 0.33–7.58, p = .515) (Table 3)."""	Allele T is associated with decreased clinical benefit to prednisolone in children with Thrombocytopenia as compared to allele C.	T	C
rs661899	MGAT5	ursodeoxycholic acid	37845416	Efficacy	yes	"""Rs661899 was strongly related to response to UDCA therapy according to Barcelona (p = 0.000098), Paris I (p = 0.012), Rotterdam (p = 0.027) and Paris II criteria (p = 0.0048), especially by the standard of Barcelona and Paris II and biochemical responders were more frequently observed in patients with rs661899 allele C"""	Genotype TT is associated with decreased clinical benefit to ursodeoxycholic acid in people with Cholangitis as compared to genotypes CC + CT.
