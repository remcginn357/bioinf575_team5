rs1801253	ADRB1	metoprolol	This SNP was presented as ADRB1 Arg389Gly. Subjects were given dobutamine with and without metoprolol pre-treatment in order to evaluate this SNPs effect on responsiveness to beta-blocker treatment. The increase in fractional shortening (FS) due to dobutamine was greater in subjects homozygous for the Arg allele as compared to Gly carriers.

This study was interested in the effect of this SNP in tandem with rs61767072. Patients homozygous for the Arg amino acid showed significantly less occurrences of all cause mortality, cardiac transplant, or heart failure hospitalizations as compared to other patients. Patients carrying the Gly amino acid but were homozygous for the wildtype allele at rs61767072 responded worse than those that were homozygous for wildtype allele at this SNP, but much better than patients carrying the variant allele at both SNPs. Patients carrying the variant allele at both SNPs and were treated with bucindolol had worse outcomes than those that were given a placebo.

rs1801253	ADRB1	dobutamine	Healthy male individuals with the CC genotype had a greater increase in fractional shortening (FS) after cumulative doses of dobutamine, compared to G allele carriers. Response in FS was compared by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the dose-response relationship of GG and GC+CC.

Genotype CC is associated with increased response to dobutamine in healthy individuals as compared to genotypes CG + GG.	CC	G
rs1801253	ADRB1	dobutamine	Patients with the CC genotype had significantly greater increases in systolic blood pressure (mmHg) upon cumulative doses of dobutamine, compared to carriers of the G allele.

rs1801253	ADRB1	metoprolol	Patients with the CC genotype (homozygous for Arg389) had a more significant decrease in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure than patients with the GG genotype (homozygous for Gly389). Patients with the CG genotype (heterozygous for Gly389Arg) had less of a decrease than patients with the CC genotype, but more of a decrease than patients with the GG genotype. There was no significant difference between patients with the different genotypes in regards to heart rate. This SNP was also studied in conjunction with rs1801252. However, the influence from rs1801252 is small compared to the influence from rs1801253.  This study showed that patients with one or more G allele did not respond to metoprolol and were classified as non-responders, while patients homozygous for the C allele had a good response and thus are labeled good responders.

Significance for this segment of the study was set at p < 0.01 for a partially corrected p, and in Whites, this level was met when a partial correction for multiple testing was done.

The TT genotype with nLES high adversity was associated with non-response, compared to the CC/CT genotype and nLES low adversity.  Please note; in the paper this SNP was reported with A and G alleles - here we use T and C to represent these. nLES = life event scale.	Genotype TT is associated with decreased response to Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or venlafaxine in people with Depressive Disorder, Major as compared to genotypes CC + CT.	TT	T
rs502434	GRIA3	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine	Regression model looking at interaction between genetic and environemental factors. The CC genotype with CTQ-SF high adversity was associated with non-response, compared to the TT/TC genotype and CTQ-SF low adversity.  Please note; in the paper this SNP was reported with A and G alleles - here we use T and C to represent these. CTQ-SF = childhood trauma questionaire 28-item short form.	Genotype CC is associated with decreased response to Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or venlafaxine in people with Depressive Disorder, Major as compared to genotypes CT + TT.	CC	T
rs3810651	GABRQ	venlafaxine	Those with the AA/AT genotype are more likely to be responders. Please note; this is an A/T SNP and due to inconsistencies reported for other SNP alleles in the paper this should be kept in mind.	Genotypes AA + AT are associated with increased response to venlafaxine in people with Depressive Disorder, Major as compared to genotype TT.	AA + AT	T
rs17435	MECP2	cisplatin, fluorouracil, mitoxantrone	The study described this variant within the MECP2 gene which is on the minus chromosomal strand, the allele associated with increased response is therefore not clear. [stat_test: chi squared allele test]	Allele A is associated with response to cisplatin, fluorouracil and mitoxantrone in people with Carcinoma, Hepatocellular as compared to allele T.	A	T
rs1734787	MECP2	cisplatin, fluorouracil, mitoxantrone	The study described this variant within the MECP2 gene which is on the minus chromosomal strand, and reported the association between complementary alleles T and G. [stat_test: chi squared allele test]	Allele A is associated with response to cisplatin, fluorouracil and mitoxantrone in people with Carcinoma, Hepatocellular as compared to allele C.	A	A
rs1734791	MECP2	cisplatin, fluorouracil, mitoxantrone	The study described this variant within the MECP2 gene which is on the minus chromosomal strand, the allele associated with increased response is therefore not clear. [stat_test: chi squared allele test]	Allele A is associated with response to cisplatin, fluorouracil and mitoxantrone in people with Carcinoma, Hepatocellular as compared to allele T.	A	A
